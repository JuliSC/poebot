# This is poebot
## A simple rss feed processor that gets the latest news about free stuff from the popular ARPG Path of Exile by Grinding Gear Games.

This is definetely not the best or even the cleanest way to do this. I mostly did it to freshen up my python programming.
But if you are lazy like me and don't want to check the pathofexile.com website for news everyday feel free to download or improve upon my work.

## How to install
!DISCLAIMER! Current version only works on Windows 10 with notepad++ installed in the default directory. Download at https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/

Just download the code from the repo. You'll find a main.exe file in the dist/main folders. Either make a shortcut to this file or set up a task in Windows Scheduler.

## How to use
Starting the program will bring up a notification that you can click to open notepad++. Here you will see all the news that might include free mystery boxes 
and all the news that might contain twitch drops. News that haven't been seen before will be highlighted with "NEW".
